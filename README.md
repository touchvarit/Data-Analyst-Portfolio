## Introduction
I am passionate about using data to gain insights, solve problems, and communicate meaningful information. My data journey began during my undergraduate engineering course, where I used Excel for physics and chemistry labs. Over time, I expanded my skill set to include SQL, Python, R, and various data visualization tools to explore data from different angles.

### High School: A Glimpse into Marketing
In my high school years, I became captivated by marketing and the art of persuading buyers. A book titled "Data-Driven Marketing: Smart Marketing Using Data" by Mr. Nui Nattapon Muangtum was my first encounter with the power of data in decision-making.

One case study stood out: a grocery store sending discounts to expectant mothers. The data-driven prediction was spot on, showcasing the incredible potential of extracting insights from data.

### Exploring Statistics
My fascination with data led me to delve into statistics. A favorite book during this period was "How to Lie with Statistics" by Darrell Huff, an unconventional yet eye-opening exploration of statistics' deceptive potential.

### Connecting the Dots: Statistics and Behavioral Economics
I started connecting my knowledge of statistics to areas like behavioral economics, examining human behavior in relation to money and decision-making. Intriguing questions emerged, such as how casinos optimize lighting and sound to encourage spending.

My quest to combine economics and data analysis led me to econometrics, a field closely related to data analysis and research.

### High School Graduation: A Turning Point
Joining the engineering club in my senior year, I encountered SPSS, a tool for statistical analysis. This experience solidified my passion for working with data and made me realize that data science encompasses more than just technology, business, and mathematics.

## Projects
### 1. Personal Database with SQL
I have created a personal SQL database inspired by Derek Sivers' idea of collecting data about people I know. This project has allowed me to practice database management, data modeling, and SQL querying.

### 2. Statistics Education Slides
I prepared statistics slides based on my bootcamp and engineering statistics knowledge to teach high school students, particularly those majoring in mathematics and science. Effective data communication is essential, and this project showcases my ability to simplify complex concepts.

### 3. Learning Progress Dashboard
Using Looker Studio, I built a dashboard to help my parents track my learning progress at university. This project demonstrates my data visualization skills and my ability to make data-driven information accessible to non-technical audiences.

### 4. Portfolio Website
I designed and developed a portfolio website using Canva. This platform serves as a showcase for my data projects and analysis work, reflecting my dedication to presenting data in an engaging and visually appealing manner.

### 5. Research on Human Bias in Rock, Paper, Scissors (R)
I conducted a research project on human bias in the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using the R programming language. This project highlights my data analysis skills and ability to design and execute research studies.

### 6. Rocket Trajectory Simulation (Python)
I created a rocket trajectory simulation project in Python. This project demonstrates my data modeling and simulation skills, particularly in the field of physics and engineering.
