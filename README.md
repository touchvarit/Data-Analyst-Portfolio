## Why Data Analyst? 
### Exploring Statistics
During my high school years, I developed a strong interest in marketing and the art of persuading buyers. It was during this time that I had my first exposure to the power of data-driven decision-making through the book "Data-Driven Marketing: Smart Marketing Using Data" by Mr. Nui Nattapon Muangtum. My fascination with data continued to grow, leading me to explore the field of statistics. One of my favorite books during this period was "How to Lie with Statistics" by Darrell Huff, which provided an unconventional yet eye-opening exploration of the deceptive potential of statistics. I also joined the engineering club, where I had the opportunity to work with SPSS, a tool for statistical analysis. This experience not only solidified my passion for working with data but also helped me realize that data science encompasses more than just technology, business, and mathematics.

### Data Science Bootcamp 8 
I am thrilled to have been awarded a full scholarship from Datarockie to pursue their Data Science Bootcamp 8 program. Over time, my curiosity and passion for data have driven me to expand my skill set, which now includes proficiency in SQL, Python, R, and various data visualization tools. Currently, I am studying at the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, and I am actively applying these skills to address personal challenges and connect them to my academic endeavors.

## Projects
### 1. Personal Database with SQL
I have created a personal SQL database inspired by Derek Sivers' idea of collecting data about people I know. This project has allowed me to practice database management, data modeling, and SQL querying.

### 2. Statistics Education Slides
I prepared statistics slides based on my bootcamp and engineering statistics knowledge to teach high school students, particularly those majoring in mathematics and science. Effective data communication is essential, and this project showcases my ability to simplify complex concepts.

### 3. Learning Progress Dashboard
Using Looker Studio, I built a dashboard to help my parents track my learning progress at university. This project demonstrates my data visualization skills and my ability to make data-driven information accessible to non-technical audiences.

### 4. Portfolio Website
I designed and developed a portfolio website using Canva. This platform serves as a showcase for my data projects and analysis work, reflecting my dedication to presenting data in an engaging and visually appealing manner.

### 5. Research on Human Bias in Rock, Paper, Scissors (R)
I conducted a research project on human bias in the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using the R programming language. This project highlights my data analysis skills and ability to design and execute research studies.

### 6. Rocket Trajectory Simulation (Python)
I created a rocket trajectory simulation project in Python. This project demonstrates my data modeling and simulation skills, particularly in the field of physics and engineering.
